    "This tutorial will demonstrate the use of DeepRank2 for generating protein-protein interface (PPI) graphs and saving them as [HDF5 files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) files, using [PBD files](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)>) of protein-protein complexes as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data processing phase, for each protein-protein complex an interface is selected according to a distance threshold that the user can customize, and it is mapped to a graph. Nodes either represent residues or atoms, and edges are the interactions between them. Each node and edge can have several different features, which are generated and added during the processing phase as well. Optionally, the graphs can be mapped to volumetric grids (i.e., 3D image-like representations), together with their features. The mapped data are finally saved into HDF5 files, and can be used for later models' training (for details go to [training_ppi.ipynb](https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank2/blob/main/tutorials/training_ppi.ipynb) tutorial). In particular, graphs can be used for the training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and grids can be used for the training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\n"
